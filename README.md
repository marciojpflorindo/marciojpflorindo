### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MÃ¡rcio and I'm a tech writer with 15+ years of experience. Right now I'm learning full-stack and React in my free time. I'm on a journey to build awesome things.

Here I have several projects I made as a way to practice concepts, and most of them have a dedicaded page you can browse to see the code in action.

Right now, I'm working as a communication coordinator at AFS Portugal.
